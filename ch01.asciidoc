== Join the Publishing Revolution

Thank you for your interest in Atlas! Atlas is a wiki-like, git-managed authoring platform for creating books. If you haven't already, you may want to check out the http://atlas.labs.oreilly.com/getting_started[getting started video] ((("video", "introduction to Atlas")))for a quick introduction to Atlas.

You can find more details and instructions in the http://cdn.oreilly.com/atlas_docs.zip[written documentation].

Some of the features of Atlas are as follows:

Simple markup::
  Atlas supports http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[AsciiDoc] and, for simpler projects, http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown].
Git backend::
  If you have a book, you have a http://git-scm.com/[git] repository and all of the power and convenience that comes with using git version control.
Easy book and ebook builds::
  Atlas lets you build your project in three formats at any time: Mobi (for the Kindle), EPUB (for most other ebook platforms), and PDF. Atlas also gives you tools to debug your ebook formats so that you can identify and fix problems quickly.
An invitation system::
  Add collaborators to your project at any time by simply sending an invite.
Flexible writing options::
  You can write directly within Atlas, but if writing in a web browser is not for you, no problem. Just use git to clone your book to a local machine and write in the text editor of your choice.

=== How It Works

. Receive an invite(((invitation))) from an O'Reilly editor or another author and create an account.
. Write in AsciiDoc, an open source text format developed by http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Stuart Rackham]. Each time you save a file, it will be logged into a git repository, so it's always under version control.
. When you're ready, build your book. Atlas interfaces with O'Reilly's publishing toolchain, generating PDF, EPUB, and Mobi files for you on the fly. Theebook files look just like those for sale on oreilly.com.

Why bother with this, you ask? We're trying to create an appealing authoring process that will get you writing as quickly as possible.

We're just getting started with Atlas, and you can play a role in determining future development by using the platform to write your book. If you're willing to use Atlas, we ask that you:

* Write in AsciiDoc, which is the preferred formats for Atlas.
* Provide feedback. Atlas is currently in alpha testing, and we need to hear from you to take the platform to the next level.
