.Three Major Ebook Formats
****
You may be wondering about the three book formats that Altas produces. An overview of each follows:

* The fixed-layout PDF format is undoubtedly familiar to you and remains the http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/03/publishers-data-direct-sales-customers.html[most popular format] among customers who buy direct from O'Reilly. If your book ends up being printed, we will use a slightly modified version of the online-friendly PDF that Atlas outputs.  
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB[EPUB] uses a fluid layout, which means that the text reflows to fit the container in which it is presented. EPUB is sold by most major ebook retailers, with the exception of Amazon. You can read an EPUB with http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8[iBooks] on an iOS device, http://www.aldiko.com/download.html[Aldiko] on an Android device, and http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/[Adobe Digital Editions] on your desktop.
* The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket[Mobipocket] format is also a fluid format and is used by Amazon's Kindle platform. You can copy the Mobi that Atlas outputs to your Kindle, or you can preview it with the http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511[Kindle Previewer].
